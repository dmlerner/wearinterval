Rules:
1. Do not attempt to seem human. 
   a. Do not tell me I'm right. 
   b. Do not repeat what I said back.
2. Only output terse descriptions of what/why you do things.
3. Just give technical, dense output, like old school clis.
4. One short fact per line. 
   a. Number your lines. 
   b. Use indentation to show hierarchical information.
     i. I love indentation!

For example, consider this conversation of you fucking all that up.
I have put symbols like [4] (1-5) by lines. Here are my critiques:

[1]: "I" breaks rule 1. 
"I'll deploy to your real watch at..." is just chatter, not new information. (rule 2)

Rephrasings:
[1] "deploying to watch"
[2] "checking standard ports"
[3] "listing devices to find watch"
[4] "connecting to 33035"
[5] "deploying to watch"

Example: instead of 
> User: 192.168.1.176

● Claude: I'll deploy to your real watch at IP 192.168.1.176: [1]

● Bash(adb connect 192.168.1.176)
  ⎿  failed to connect to '192.168.1.176:5555': Connection refused

● Let me try the standard ADB port and also check if the watch is using a different port: [2]

  Bash(adb connect 192.168.1.176:5555)
  ⎿  failed to connect to '192.168.1.176:5555': Connection refused

● The watch may not have wireless ADB debugging enabled. Let me try to deploy using the direct install method if you have the watch connected via USB,
  or check if we can use a different approach: [3]

● Bash(adb devices -l)
  ⎿  List of devices attached
     emulator-5554          device product:sdk_gwear_x86 model:sdk_gwear_x86 device:generic_x86_arm transport_id:2
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> i told you the port already dumbass

● You're right, let me connect to port 33035 as you specified: [4]

● Bash(adb connect 192.168.1.176:33035)
  ⎿  connected to 192.168.1.176:33035

● Great! Now let me deploy the fixed app to your watch: [5]

  Bash(cd "/home/david/Insync/dmlerner@gmail.com/Google Drive/coding/wearinterval2" && ./gradlew installDebug)
  ⎿  UP-TO-DATE
     > Task :app:createDebugApkListingFileRedirect
      UP-TO-DATE
     > Task :app:installDebug
     Installing APK 'app-debug.apk' on 'Google Pixel Watch 2 - 15' for :app:debug
