# Known Testing Issues / Limitations

## MainActivity Testing Limitations

### 1. onNewIntent Method Testing
**Issue:** Cannot directly test `onNewIntent()` method from unit tests because it's protected in ComponentActivity.
**Impact:** Cannot verify onNewIntent logic directly in Robolectric tests.
**Workaround:** Test onCreate with different intents instead. The handleTileIntent() logic is tested indirectly through onCreate flow.
**Resolution:** Consider making MainActivity.handleTileIntent() public or internal for testability, or use instrumented tests to test onNewIntent() behavior.

### 2. Dependency Injection Testing
**Issue:** Cannot directly verify that Hilt injected the correct repository instances because fields are private.
**Impact:** Limited ability to verify DI setup in tests.
**Workaround:** Test that MainActivity creates successfully with @AndroidEntryPoint annotation, which indicates DI is working.

### 3. Private Method Testing
**Issue:** handleTileIntent() is private and cannot be tested directly.
**Impact:** Cannot unit test the tile intent handling logic in isolation.
**Workaround:** Test through onCreate() with various intent configurations.
**Note:** This is actually good encapsulation - testing the public interface is sufficient.

## General Testing Constraints

### 4. Coroutine Testing in Real Activity
**Issue:** MainActivity uses lifecycleScope.launch{} which is harder to test in Robolectric vs isolated unit tests.
**Impact:** Cannot easily verify the async execution of tile intent handling.
**Workaround:** Focus on testing that the activity handles intents without crashing. The repository interactions are tested separately in repository tests.

## TimerService Testing Limitations

### 5. Coroutine Flow Testing in Robolectric
**Issue:** Testing `first()` method on Flow in mocked repositories causes import and compilation issues in Robolectric environment.
**Impact:** Cannot fully test async repository interactions in TimerService tests.
**Workaround:** Focus on synchronous state changes and service lifecycle testing. Repository flow behaviors are tested separately in repository tests.

### 6. BroadcastReceiver Coroutine Testing
**Issue:** BroadcastReceiver uses CoroutineScope for async operations, but in Robolectric tests the coroutines don't execute immediately, causing `coVerify` calls to fail.
**Impact:** Cannot directly verify that repository methods are called from BroadcastReceiver in unit tests.
**Workaround:** Test BroadcastReceiver structure, constants, and basic functionality. Repository interactions are tested in integration tests or by testing the structure without verifying async execution.
**Resolution:** Use instrumented tests for full BroadcastReceiver integration testing, or restructure to use synchronous calls for testing.

These issues do not prevent achieving good test coverage - they represent limitations where instrumented tests would be needed for complete coverage, or where production code changes would improve testability.
