# WearInterval - Feature Specification

## Overview

WearInterval is a comprehensive Wear OS interval timer application built with modern Android architecture patterns. The app provides sophisticated timer functionality with full Wear OS integration including tiles, complications, and optimized navigation for small watch screens.

## Core Features

### 1. Interval Timer Configuration

#### Timer Parameters
- **Work Duration**: 1 second to 10 minutes
- **Rest Duration**: 0 seconds to 10 minutes (optional)
- **Lap Count**: 1 to 999 laps (999 = infinite mode)

#### Configuration Methods
- **Manual Configuration**: Custom picker interface for precise timing
- **Preset Selection**: Common interval configurations (5x45s/15s, 8x25s/5s, etc.)
- **History-Based**: Quick selection from recently used configurations

#### Validation & Constraints
- Automatic validation of timer parameters within allowed ranges
- Coercion of invalid values to nearest valid range
- Support for zero rest duration (timer-only mode)
- Special handling for infinite lap mode (999 laps)

### 2. Timer Execution Engine

#### Timer States
- **Stopped**: Ready to start, displays configuration preview
- **Running**: Active work interval countdown
- **Resting**: Active rest interval countdown (if configured)
- **Paused**: Timer suspended, retains all progress
- **Alarm Active**: Manual mode notification requiring user dismissal

#### Core Timer Logic
- **Precise Timing**: 100ms update intervals for smooth progress
- **Background Operation**: Foreground service ensures timer continues when app is minimized
- **State Persistence**: Timer survives app restarts and device sleep
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time calculation of interval and overall progress

#### Timer Controls
- **Play/Pause**: Start new timer or pause/resume active timer
- **Stop**: Immediately terminate timer and reset to configuration
- **Skip Rest**: During rest periods, advance to next work interval
- **Dismiss Alarm**: In manual mode, acknowledge completion and continue

### 3. User Interface Design

#### Main Timer Screen
- **Dual Progress Rings**: 
  - Outer ring: Overall workout progress
  - Inner ring: Current interval progress
- **Central Display**: Current time, remaining duration, lap progress
- **Contextual Controls**: Play/pause/stop buttons with state-aware icons
- **Visual Feedback**: Color coding for work (blue/green) vs rest (yellow) periods

#### Navigation Structure
- **4-Screen Horizontal Pager**: 
  - History (left swipe)
  - Main Timer (center)
  - Configuration (right swipe)
  - Settings (far right)
- **Optimized for Wear OS**: Large touch targets, swipe-based navigation

#### Configuration Interface
- **Scrollable Pickers**: Individual controls for laps, work time, rest time
- **Real-time Preview**: Display string updates as parameters change
- **Grid-based Presets**: 2x2 grid of common interval configurations

### 4. History & Persistence

#### Configuration History
- **Automatic Saving**: Every timer start creates history entry with timestamp
- **Recent Access**: Up to 6 most recently used configurations
- **Quick Selection**: Tap any history item to load configuration
- **Persistent Storage**: Room database with automatic cleanup of old entries

#### Data Models
- **TimerConfiguration**: Immutable data class with validation methods
- **Entity Mapping**: Room entities with proper type converters
- **Display Formatting**: Smart duration formatting and lap display

### 5. Settings & Customization

#### Notification Behavior
- **Auto Mode**: Timer continues automatically between intervals
- **Manual Mode**: Requires user dismissal at each interval boundary
- **Vibration Patterns**: Configurable intensity and patterns
- **Sound Alerts**: Interval completion and workout finish notifications

#### Screen Management
- **Keep Screen On**: During active timer to prevent sleep
- **Brightness Control**: Automatic adjustment based on timer state
- **Battery Optimization**: Intelligent wake lock management

### 6. Wear OS Integration

#### Tile Service
- **Dynamic Content**: Shows recent configurations when stopped
- **Live Updates**: Real-time timer display when running
- **Direct Launch**: Tap configurations to start timers immediately
- **2x2 Grid Layout**: Matches main app's history screen design

#### Complications
- **Multiple Types**: Short text, long text, ranged value, small image
- **Real-time Updates**: 30-second refresh during active timers
- **Status Display**: Current lap and time remaining
- **Isolated Service**: Independent of main app lifecycle

#### Notifications
- **Foreground Service**: Persistent timer notification with controls
- **Alert Notifications**: Interval completion with haptic feedback
- **Action Buttons**: Play/pause/stop directly from notification
- **Wear-Optimized**: Proper sizing and interaction patterns

### 7. Advanced Features

#### Configuration Synchronization
- **Live Updates**: Running timers adapt to configuration changes
- **Progress Preservation**: Ring progress maintained during parameter changes
- **Rescaling Logic**: Proportional time adjustment for consistency

#### Power Management
- **Wake Lock Control**: Partial wake lock during active timers only
- **Background Efficiency**: Minimal battery drain when app inactive
- **Service Lifecycle**: Proper binding and cleanup patterns

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Service Connection**: Automatic reconnection on service failures
- **State Recovery**: Restore timer state after crashes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation with limited functionality
