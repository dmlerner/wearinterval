- ✅ **Unit Tests**: 280+ tests with 100% pass rate
- ⚠️ **UI Composables**: 0-19% coverage (requires Android runtime)
- ⚠️ **Android Framework**: 0% coverage (requires device/emulator)

### To Execute UI Tests & Improve Coverage:
1. **Set up Android Emulator**:

   avdmanager create avd -n WearOS_API_30 -k "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64" --device "wear_round"
   
   # Start emulator
   emulator -avd WearOS_API_30
   ```

2. **Run Instrumented Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Execute UI tests on emulator
   ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
   
   # Generate combined coverage report
   ./gradlew createDebugCoverageReport
   ```
