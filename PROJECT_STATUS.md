## Currently Working On
**Ready to begin Phase 3 - Domain Layer (Repositories)**

## Next Up
- Implement SettingsRepository with DataStore integration
- Implement ConfigurationRepository with Room and DataStore integration  
- Implement TimerRepository with service binding and state management
- Create WearOsRepository foundation for platform integration
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all repository implementations

## Coverage Metrics
- **Unit Tests**: High coverage for data models and services (84 tests)
- **Integration Tests**: DAO tests implemented (ConfigurationDaoTest)
- **UI Tests**: 0% (UI layer not yet implemented)
- **Overall**: Strong data layer foundation with comprehensive testing

## Architecture Decisions
- Chosen MVVM + Repository pattern for separation of concerns
- Selected Hilt for dependency injection
- Using Room for local database (configuration history)
- Using DataStore for settings and current configuration
- Implementing foreground service for reliable timer operation
- Using Jetpack Compose for Wear OS UI

## Technical Approach
- Test-driven development with 90%+ coverage requirement
- Sapling for version control with atomic commits
- Bottom-up implementation (data layer → domain → UI)
- Single source of truth pattern for state management
- Unidirectional data flow with StateFlow

## Issues & Blockers
- None currently identified
