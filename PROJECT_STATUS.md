## Currently Working On
**Ready to begin Phase 2 - Data Layer Implementation**

## Next Up
- Implement Room database (TimerConfigurationEntity, ConfigurationDao, AppDatabase)  
- Implement DataStore wrapper for settings and current configuration
- Create TimerService foundation with service binding
- Write comprehensive tests for all data layer components

## Coverage Metrics
- **Unit Tests**: 0% (no code yet)
- **Integration Tests**: 0% (no code yet)
- **UI Tests**: 0% (no code yet)
- **Overall**: 0% (project setup phase)

## Architecture Decisions
- Chosen MVVM + Repository pattern for separation of concerns
- Selected Hilt for dependency injection
- Using Room for local database (configuration history)
- Using DataStore for settings and current configuration
- Implementing foreground service for reliable timer operation
- Using Jetpack Compose for Wear OS UI

## Technical Approach
- Test-driven development with 90%+ coverage requirement
- Sapling for version control with atomic commits
- Bottom-up implementation (data layer → domain → UI)
- Single source of truth pattern for state management
- Unidirectional data flow with StateFlow

## Issues & Blockers
- None currently identified

## Phase 1 Tasks Status ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Wear OS project with Compose
- [x] Configure build.gradle.kts dependencies with 2025 versions
- [x] Set up JaCoCo coverage reporting

- [x] Implement NotificationSettings data class with tests (17 tests passing)
- [x] Create UiEvent sealed class hierarchy (11 tests passing)
- [x] Set up Hilt Application class
- [x] **VERIFIED:** Project builds successfully (`./gradlew assemble`)
- [x] **VERIFIED:** All tests pass (`./gradlew test` - 64/64 tests passing)

## Phase 2 Tasks Status - Data Layer Implementation
- [ ] Create TimerConfigurationEntity with Room annotations
- [ ] Implement ConfigurationDao with all CRUD operations  
- [ ] Create AppDatabase with TypeConverters
- [ ] Write comprehensive DAO integration tests
