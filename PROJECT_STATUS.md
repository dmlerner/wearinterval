## Architecture Decisions
- Chosen MVVM + Repository pattern for separation of concerns
- Selected Hilt for dependency injection
- Using Room for local database (configuration history)
- Using DataStore for settings and current configuration
- Implementing foreground service for reliable timer operation
- Using Jetpack Compose for Wear OS UI

## Technical Approach
- Test-driven development with 90%+ coverage requirement
- Sapling for version control with atomic commits
- Bottom-up implementation (data layer → domain → UI)
- Single source of truth pattern for state management
- Unidirectional data flow with StateFlow

## Issues & Blockers
- **Resolved**: All 280+ unit tests now passing with 100% success rate
- **Resolved**: Instrumented test compilation issues fixed with proper dependencies and internal interfaces
- **Active**: 19/64 instrumented tests failing - DataStore singleton conflicts and UI element assertions
- **Active**: Test failures include: DataStoreIntegrationTest (10 DataStore conflicts), MainScreenTest (8 UI assertions), HistoryScreenTest (1 duplicate element)
- **Coverage Impact**: 25% overall coverage due to UI test failures; business logic fully covered (99-100%)
- **Next**: Fix DataStore test isolation and UI content descriptions before Phase 7
- **Testing Strategy**: Headless testing infrastructure working; fixing specific test issues

## UI Coverage Requirements ⚠️ EMULATOR NEEDED
To significantly improve the 25% overall coverage, **an Android emulator or physical device is required**:

### Current Coverage Status:
- ✅ **Business Logic**: 99-100% coverage (domain models, repositories, utilities)
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: 280+ tests with 100% pass rate
- ⚠️ **UI Composables**: 0-19% coverage (requires Android runtime)
- ⚠️ **Android Framework**: 0% coverage (requires device/emulator)

### To Execute UI Tests & Improve Coverage:
1. **Set up Android Emulator**:
   ```bash
   # Create Wear OS AVD
   avdmanager create avd -n WearOS_API_30 -k "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64" --device "wear_round"
   
   # Start emulator
   emulator -avd WearOS_API_30
   ```

2. **Run Instrumented Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Execute UI tests on emulator
   ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
   
   # Generate combined coverage report
   ./gradlew createDebugCoverageReport
   ```

3. **Expected Coverage Improvement**:
   - Current: 25% overall coverage
   - With UI tests: 65-75% overall coverage
   - All UI Composables and Android components tested

### Headless Testing Status:
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Complete headless testing setup with scripts and CI/CD
- ✅ **Execution**: Successfully ran 64 instrumented tests on headless Wear OS emulator  
- ✅ **Test Reports**: Generated detailed test reports at `app/build/reports/androidTests/connected/debug/`
- ⚠️ **Test Results**: 45/64 tests passing (70% pass rate) - DataStore and UI assertion issues
- ⚠️ **Failing Tests**: DataStoreIntegrationTest (10 failures), MainScreenTest (8 failures), HistoryScreenTest (1 failure)
- ✅ **Ready for Fixes**: Infrastructure proven working; specific test issues identified

### Test Execution Summary:
- **Total Tests**: 64 instrumented tests executed
- **Passing**: 45 tests (ConfigurationDaoTest, ProgressRingComposeTest, most UI screens)
- **Failing**: 19 tests (DataStore singleton conflicts, UI content description mismatches)  
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Working perfectly - tests run automatically without GUI

**Note**: Headless testing infrastructure is production-ready. Current failures are fixable test-specific issues, not infrastructure problems.
